# ScrabbleHelper
Do not use it to cheat :trollface:

## What is this? 🔎
A weekend idea to practice with a FullStack project.

## How does it work? 👷
Insert some letters into the textBox and click submity, the page will display a list of words that can help you with Scrabble.

## Technical 🏗️
The solution contains a SPA proyect with an API running under NET 6.0, other proyect with UnitTesting methods, a frontend proyect that runs with React, TypeScript and Bootstrap. I have also tried to work on the responsiveness design so that it is friendly with desktop, tablet and smartphone screens.

## DevOps
Using GitHub Actions the app is deployed automatically to Azure after any changes in master branch.
